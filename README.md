# QTproject
2022Spring, QT project of OOP, PKU, based on QT5.   
2022年春季学期PKU程序设计实习QT大作业      

This is a two-player game, where the players can select their heroes and fight on the soccer field, aiming at shooting at the goal(by both the body and the "bullets"!). This game implements a basic physical collision system, all the objects in the game can interact with each other based on classical mechanics(however we didn't take the rotation in condiseration). Use the bullets, skills or even only your flesh to beat your friends! We also implement the record system in this game, by which the game system will record the latest 5 records of the games end normally, and we can review them on the menu.
